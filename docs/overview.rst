Overview
========

Introduction
------------

*pyrocore* is part of the
`PyroScope <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/PyroScope.md>`_
family of projects, and offers a collection of tools for the `BitTorrent
protocol <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/BitTorrent.md>`_
and especially the rTorrent client. This includes:

  * `CommandLineTools <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/CommandLineTools.md>`_
    for automation of common tasks, like metafile creation, and
    `filtering and mass-changing your loaded
    torrents <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/RtControlExamples.md>`_.
  * rTorrent extensions like a
    `QueueManager <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/QueueManager.md>`_
    and statistics (*work in progress*).
  * All this is based on the ``pyrocore`` Python package, that you can
    use to `write your own
    scripts <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/WriteYourOwnScripts.md>`_
    for any special needs that aren't covered by the standard tools.

See the
`ScreenShotGallery <https://github.com/pyroscope/pyroscope/blob/wiki/ScreenShotGallery.md>`_
if you want to get a first impression without installing the software.

Customization
