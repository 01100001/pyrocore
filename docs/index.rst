Welcome to pyrocore's documentation!
====================================

``pyrocore`` is a collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol
and especially the rTorrent client.

The *PyroScope* command line utilities are *not* the same as
`rTorrent-PS <https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps>`_, and they work
perfectly fine without it; the same is true the other way 'round. It's
just that both unsurprisingly have synergies if used together, and some
features *do* only work when both are present.
